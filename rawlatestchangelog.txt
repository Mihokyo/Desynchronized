Rewritten code to conform to the "information system" standard
banishment: rewritten, +new rudimentary letter
executions: rewritten, +new rudimentary letter
kidnaps: +more thoughts, set is complete
organ harvests: rewritten, no feature changes
underlying code: tale code: "colonist" -> "pawn"
Small optimization: whenever a pawn is downed, the game no longer proceeds to try to give any thoughts: in vanilla game, the downed status means nothing.
fixed colonists still knowing about executions that happened outside of their home map (for Randy's sake this bug appeared before)
