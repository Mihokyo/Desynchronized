A continuation of Closed Doors, pawns under the effect of this mod will not respond to some events that happen outside of their map.\n\n
Currently, the events that are suppressed are Execution events and Organ Harvesting events. More suppressed responses to come in the future.\n\n
Is safe to add to/remove from existing save-games. Should have no compatibility problems.
