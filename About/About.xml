	<description>Change your Colonists' minds.

A continuation of Closed Doors, this mod changes how your Colonists react to the outside world.

Your Colonists will now be unable to get Thoughts from events happening outside of their own Map, even some new Thoughts created by this mod too, opening some new playstyles for experimentation. But still, be wary, as your Colonists will soon be able to exchange news with each other, spreading information that you may deem undesirable, causing unexpected mess and chaos among order.

Ask yourself: is knowledge power, or is ignorance bliss?
