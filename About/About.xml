	<description>Change your Colonists' minds.

A continuation of MoobyNooby's ClosedDoors, this mod changes how your colonists react to the outside world.

As your colonists are scattered across the globe, so are their knowledge. The inability for them to know everything at the get go creates an inevitable desynchronization of understanding.

How should your colonists comprehend the unforgiving and absurd world around them?
