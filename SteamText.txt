[h1]Mod Description[/h1]
A continuation of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1315706945]ClosedDoors[/url] made by MoobyNooby, this mod changes how your colonists react to the outside world.

A question: What will happen when colonists lose their omniscience and become oblivious to events that transpire behind closed doors or beyond their sweet homes?

[h1]Features List[/h1]
Visit the [url=https://github.com/Vectorial1024/Desynchronized]GitHub repo[/url] for more details, but here are some highlights:
[list]
[*]Colonists will generally not react to events that does not happen inside their own maps.
[*]Colonists will now have a small chance to spread news about events that has happened, spreading from those who know to those who do not. (Configurable in Mod Settings)

[h1]Credits[/h1]
This mod would not have been here without the following people:
[list]
[*]MoobyNooby for keeping the code live so they can be passed on
[*]Y'all subscribers for investing your time in this [i]ex-[/i]WIP product
[*][strike]Jaxe and his [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1510554297]PublisherPlus[/url], a fine mod that allows me to exclude unnecessary directories to reduce file size (reduced from 20MB due to redundant compiler-generated files, down to <2MB, containing only the core files necessary for this mod)[/strike] Apparently his mod broke, but still he deserves some credit
[*]pardeike's Harmony library and UnlimitedHugs' HugsLib for providing much-needed convenience to make mods
[*]Tynan for this game; and most importantly,
[*]That one guy who first got an idea and eventually catalyzed the creation of this mod
[/list]
That's all. Wish y'all a successful run on the Rim!
