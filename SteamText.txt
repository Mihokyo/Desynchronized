[h1]Description[/h1]
Have you wondered why your Colonists seem to have omnipresense that they know of some execution and deaths many KM away from their home-base?

Have you ever wondered how a practical Gulag can be set up inside RimWorld? [b]Disclaimer: This mod does not intend to encourage the establishment of any real-life gulags.[/b]

Well, say no more!

This mod re-educates your Colonists to be more... realistic. They will stop knowing things that are not even happening on the map they are living in. Why worry about something far away when you can't even in your own map?

[b]Requires HugsLib. Warning should have been given if HugsLib is not detected.[/b]

[b]This mod is still a WIP, features may be missing. I will be adding more features over time to make this mod more complete.[/b]
