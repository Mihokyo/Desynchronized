[h1]Mod Description[/h1]
A continuation of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1315706945]ClosedDoors[/url] made by MoobyNooby, this mod changes how your Colonists react to the outside world.

Your Colonists will now be unable to get Thoughts from events happening outside of their own Map, even some new Thoughts created by this mod too, opening some new playstyles for experimentation.

But still, be wary, as your Colonists will soon be able to exchange news with each other, spreading information that you may deem undesirable, causing unexpected mess and chaos among order.

Ask yourself: is knowledge power, or is ignorance bliss?

[b]This mod is still a WIP, features may be missing. I will be adding more features over time to make this mod more complete.[/b]

[h1]Features List[/h1]
Visit the [url=https://github.com/Vectorial1024/Desynchronized]GitHub repo[/url] for more details, but here are some highlights:
[list]
[*]Colonists will not get deboffs from distant Executions, Organ Harvests, and etc.
[*]Colonists will now get debuffs related to kidnap events; more kidnap- and raid-related thoughts to come in the v1.2 updates

This mod would not have been here without the following people:
[list]
[*]MoobyNooby for keeping the code live so they can be passed on
[*]Y'all subscribers for investing your time in this WIP product
[*]Jaxe and his [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1510554297]PublisherPlus[/url], a fine mod that allows me to exclude unnecessary directories to reduce file size (reduced from 20MB due to redundant compiler-generated files, down to <2MB, containing only the core files necessary for this mod)
