		<content>Greetings, mod user. Thank you for using &lt;color=cyan&gt;Desynchronized&lt;/color&gt;, a WIP mod that aims to change how Colonists react to the outside world.|The only change in this update is that &lt;color=cyan&gt;Desynchronized&lt;/color&gt; now requires HugsLib, which is also the reason why you are reading this right now.|Stay safe, report bugs, and have fun!</content>

		<content>A slightly overdue update! But who cares; at least we got this mod updated. Yay!|&lt;b&gt;Implemented Mandatory Censorship Scheme&lt;/b&gt;
The Scheme filteres information about the following events that originate from outside the Colonists' home-base:|- Executions, Organ Harvests, and Banishments
- Prisoners Sold
- Colonist Died and associated thoughts|Note that the vanilla game has already implemented a similar Scheme to filter the following events:|- Know Butchered Human
- Buried in Sarcophagus
- Colonist Left Unburied.|&lt;b&gt;On a more serious note:&lt;/b&gt;
- Reduced Steam Workshop file size thanks to PublisherPlus
- Changing the direction of this mod from a simple, low-level "Gulag mod" to a complex, high-level "Censorship mod"|That's all! Stay safe, report bugs, and have fun!</content>
