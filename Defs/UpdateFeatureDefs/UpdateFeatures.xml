		<content>Greetings, mod user. Thank you for using &lt;color=cyan&gt;Desynchronized&lt;/color&gt;, a WIP mod that aims to change how Colonists react to the outside world.|The only change in this update is that &lt;color=cyan&gt;Desynchronized&lt;/color&gt; now requires HugsLib, which is also the reason why you are reading this right now.|Stay safe, report bugs, and have fun!</content>

		<assemblyVersion>1.1.0</assemblyVersion>
		<content>A slightly overdue update! But who cares; at least we got this mod updated. Yay!|&lt;b&gt;Implemented Mandatory Censorship Scheme&lt;/b&gt;
The Scheme filteres information about the following events that originate from outside the Colonists' home-base:|- Executions, Organ Harvests, and Banishments
- Prisoners Sold
- Colonist Died and associated thoughts|Note that the vanilla game has already implemented a similar Scheme to filter the following events:|- Know Butchered Human
- Buried in Sarcophagus
- Colonist Left Unburied.|&lt;b&gt;On a more serious note:&lt;/b&gt;
- Reduced Steam Workshop file size thanks to PublisherPlus
- Changing the direction of this mod from a simple, low-level "Gulag mod" to a complex, high-level "Censorship mod"|That's all! Stay safe, report bugs, and have fun!</content>

		<defName>Desync_1_2_0</defName>
		<assemblyVersion>1.2.0</assemblyVersion>
		<content>Weekly update. Version 1.2 will focus on Colonists' reactions towards kidnaps in raids. Don't you realize that colonists won't have any thoughts whatsoever when someone is kidnapped?|- Added new Thought: Colonist Kidnapped (Stacks 5 times, with -2/-3/-4/-5/-6)
- More kidnap-related thoughts to come in later v1.2.* updates|I have also implemented a script that logs the Tales of kidnapped Colonists onto your desktop when DevMode is turned on. This will be useful later when I start to implement the Information Barricade.|That's all! Stay safe, report bugs, and have fun!</content>

		<defName>Desync_1_3_0</defName>
		<assemblyVersion>1.3.0</assemblyVersion>
		<content>I originally planned to upload a holiday special v1.2.2 a few days ago, but couldn't make it, so now, we have this huge update to Desynchronized: the version 1.3.0!|- Major rewrite of underlying code to conform to the "information system" standard
- Effects of existing features are unchanged
- Kidnaps: now has all the family-relation Thoughts like "my grandfather was kidnapped", "my cousin was kidnapped" etc.
- Banishment: new placeholder letter for when you banish a Colonist
- Executions: new placeholder letter for when you execute a Colonist/Guest (Prisoners are technically Guests)
- Organ Harvests: no new features (i.e., should work just as before)
- Slight (maybe non-noticable) optimization: game no longer attempts to give out thoughts when pawns are downed
- Fixed bug: Colonists should now not know about Executions happening outside of their home map (for real this time)|Click on the link above to visit the GitHub online repo, where you can find the source code, previous versions, and detailed changelogs.</content>
