transfer sender info from TravelingTransportPods to TPAA_GiveGift, then finally to Handler
Link TPAA_GiveGift instance back to TravelingTransportPods instance

Add to tracker when pods do post add: sender is known, arrivalaction is also known (arrivalaction of givegift should already be known at launch)
Load from tracker when pods do arrival action: original genguest is noped, the sender/arrivalaction pair is loaded
Take the called arrivalaction instance, look for it in the pairs, get the sender, sender can be null, and give to handler
