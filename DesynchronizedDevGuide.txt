Additional algorithm to organ harvesting:
Stealing from prisoner and donating from one should give different thoughts.
Additional thoughts related to organ donations, and family members' reactions when receiving donation, etc.

Refinement of Human Meat treatment:
Colonists wouldnt know, but certain conditions (e.g. Gourmand) will trigger a Stark Realization
SR will apply the debuff 1.5x strong and 1.5x long, etc.

Algorithm for Memory recall:
Everyone will be able to remember something from the past from time to time.
Bad mood will tend to cause bad memories to resurface, and vice versa.
Older people can have more memory recalled at the same time.

Revival
A whole basket of thoughts, just like "Pawn Died"

Inside-Job Assasination
(Credits: u/Muznick)
Pawns may lie about other events if they determine that it is OK for them to lie.
Lying strength mainly depends on social skill
This opens up playstyle where undesirables are silently purged one by one.

Additional (Misc?) Thoughts
(Credits: u/uglychip)
Made something impressive
Psychic drone relief

Additional need: Social
All humanlike pawns have a new need: Social
The Social need is just similar to Rest, Food, and Joy need.
Social need has Social Fulfillment
SF naturally decays to Base Level; Base Level is normally 0
SF naturally (but only slowly) decreases (to represent the human nature of being a social animal)
Net Social Fulfillment (NSF) = Absolute Social Fulfillment (ASF) - Base Level (BL)
+ve SF levels gives mood bonus, while -ve SF levels gives mood penalty
Neutral and positive social interactions give positive SF; others give negative SF
Having more friends (and, by extension, family members), *decreases* the Base Level, while having more rivals *increases* the Base Level
Opinions towards pawns will magnify the SF offset of the interactions. Preferrably, friends and families produce more positive SF deltas, while rivals produce more negative SF deltas.
New Mental Break: Social Anxiety: SF decrement rate is increased; Base Level is negatively offset
New Mental Break: Demotivation: social interactions no longer gives SF deltas.
Modify Mental Break: Hide in Room: SF decay rate moderately increased

Refinement mechanics: Forgetfulness
Each TaleNews has a Relevance value to a Pawn
Relevance can be influenced by many factors subject to discussion
Over time, the TN with low Relevance are forgotten
"Forgotten" TN can be Remembered; such remembrance generates a thought with less strength and duration compared to the original thought

Refinement mechanics: Information Confidence
If a colonist receives a TN first-hand, such TN will always have a 100% Confidence
(Maybe the 100% confidence is not permanent; but that's another story)
When spreading TN, the spreader will have an option to lie about the TN
The chance of lying can depend on several factors; one might be the Severity, another might be the Estimated Relevance calculated by the spreader, yet another could be Opinion
The receiver of TN will then also have a chance to determine if the spreader is lying
If the lie is not discovered, the TN Confidence will get a 100% rating, else 0%.
The Confidence rating from lies can be further adjusted based on social skills, etc.
Each colonist will have his own "Information Confidence Average"
A 50% ICA goves 0 mood delta; the more the ICA deviates from 50%, the stronger the directed mood delta is for the colonist
The colonist will get the "Information confidence (v.strong/strong/weak/v.weak)" thought based on his ICA
