I originally planned to upload a holiday special v1.2.2 a few days ago, but couldn't make it. And now, we have this huge update to Desynchronized: the version 1.3.0!

- Major rewrite of underlying code to conform to the "information system" standard
- Effects of existing features are unchanged
- Kidnaps: now has all the family-relation Thoughts like "my grandfather was kidnapped", "my cousin was kidnapped" etc.
- Banishment: new placeholder letter for when you banish a Colonist
- Executions: new placeholder letter for when you execute a Colonist/Guest (Prisoners are technically Guests)
- Organ Harvests: no new features (i.e., should work just as before)
- Slight (maybe non-noticable) optimization: game no longer attempts to give out thoughts when pawns are downed
- Fixed bug: Colonists should now not know about Executions happening outside of their home map (for real this time)
