Version 1.4.4 is here to do some house-keeping work.

- Fixed bug: doing Finish Off (from Allow Tools) on human pawns will no longer throw NullReferenceException
- Fixed bug that might have broken the entire TNDBS
- Removed unused/now-irrelevant code
- (Steam only) Reduced mod size down to <1 MB (credits to Mehni's PublisherPlus patch!)

One known issue: when loading a save-game that was made with a previous version of this mod enabled, the game will show some &lt;b&gt;one-time errors&lt;/b&gt; along the lines of "Could not find class" in the debug log. The affected classes are: InformationKnowledgeStorage, CentralTaleDatabase, ArrivalAction_Sender_Linker. &lt;b&gt;This is harmless.&lt;/b&gt;
