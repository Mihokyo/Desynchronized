It's finally here: Version 1.4. After 2 months in development, I am proud to announce that we have reached a major milestone of development: the completion of the news-spreading system.

- New concept: Tale-News (TN). A TN is a representation of an in-game event that has occured. The list of in-game events that can be represented by  the TN system will be expanded in the future as development continues. Details are on GitHub.
- New behavior: TN spreading. When doing chit-chat and deep-talk, the initiator has a small chance to tell the recipient one entry of TN. Details are on GitHub.
- New settings: You have the option to disable the TN-spreading behavior (which is enabled by default). Consult your Mod Settings for details.
- Known issue: (Steam only) Mod size boomed back up to 20MB. PublisherPlus died after the recent RimWorld update.

Many thanks to the cumulative 7000 subscribers of this mod! Your support has propelled me forward even when times are tough, to encourage me to finish what I started.

And also, 新年快樂! Happy Chinese New Year!
