Version 1.5.1 is here to kill some bugs.

- Added translation (French/Francais); credits to Mihokyo for helping out with the translation!
- Fixed bug: no more NullReferenceException when losing pawns during player-initiated attacks on faction bases
- Fixed bug: no more complaints from RimWorld about null-null "dummy" faction relations and "non-existent" self-self faction relations
- Fixed bug: no more ArgumentOutOfRangeException when attempting to randomly select a piece of news to transmit
- Cleaned up left-over developer log spam

I have come up with a good way to manage translations. From now on, the localization XML file names will also mention the version of the mod, so it will be easier for translators to spot new texts that require translation.

As a result, we are now accepting translations.

If you would like to include your error logs when reporting bugs, you may use PasteBin ( https://pastebin.com/ ) or HugsLib's log-sharing feature.
