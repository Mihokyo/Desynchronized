The North remembers.

- New concept: forgetfulness - tale-news with sufficiently low importance score will be forgotten by pawns
- Adjusted calculation of news importance for "pawn died" news
- Added more French translation (credits to Mihokyo)
- Fixed null-reference bug introduced in v1.6.0
- The news tracker UI now auto-close when the menu main tab is clicked

Re-calculation of news forgetfulness may take some time if you already have a lot of tale-news accumulated in your playthrough. You may lag out a bit during the process. I may optimize this process in a later version.

The introduction of forgetfulness means that RuntimeGC users may now clear a significant number of accumulated dead pawns using RuntimeGC. This should return performance levels to what it should have been. Just wait for about 3-6 in-game hours, and run that world-pawn cleaning function.
