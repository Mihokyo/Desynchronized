Version 1.3.4 is finally here! There was an unexpected amount of bugs in the previous version, so I couldn't make it in time to post an update. But still, here we are!

- Rewritten data structures to kill bugs that occur in the saving/loading process
- (Residue bugs from previous version's savefile may still be around, but should be less severe)
- Included "Prisoner/Colonist sold" into the "information system"
- Fixed bug: Gifting Colonists to Factions via drop-pods should now give mood debuff; this debuff applies to those in the map where the pods were launched
- Fixed bug: Bloodlust pawns should no longer get "Killed Someone" when they kill animals
- Flavour texts for "Colonist Kidnapped" and related Thoughts now open for translation
