Version 1.3.1 is here to restructure the mod in preparation to implement the "information system". And I have already decided the name of that system too. And college is resuming soon, too...

- Most code has been rewritten in compliance to the new standard
- Internal logic update: executions are now considered as another form of death
- Fixed bug: banishing a bonded animal should now correctly give Bonded Animal Banished instead of Colonist Banished (oh lol)
