Version 1.5.2 is here to improve compatibility.

- Compatibility: cleaning world pawns using RuntimeGC will not remove pawns referenced by the TaleNews system

Please note that, due to code protection, I am unable to prevent RuntimeGC from removing pawns when doing "deconstruct animal family", so please avoid using that feature.

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
Using the "deconstruct animal family" feature in RuntimeGC will still remove pawns referenced by our TaleNews system. Unfortunately, I am unable to provide a fix for this because the relevant RuntimeGC code is protected.
