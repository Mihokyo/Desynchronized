Version 1.4.3 is here to bring you some New Year happiness.

- Clarification/New Pawn stat: News spread tendency (NST). This is the value that this mod will use in calculating likeliness for pawns to spread news. It is a Social stat. Base value of NST is 0.02 (2%).
- New trait spectrum related to NST: Gossiper (+0.03 NST) and Secret-keeper (-0.015 NST). This trait spectrum is less common than average.
- Fixed bug: pawns trying to spread news will no longer have 50% chance to throw ArgumentOutOfRangeException.
- (Steam only) An attempt was made to reduce mod file size (from ~27 MB to ~15 MB)
