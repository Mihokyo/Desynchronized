- New feature: new main tab for this mod
- New feature: new tale-news UI to let us view tale-news in-game
- The tale-news UI can either display the list of all tale-news or simply display how much tale-news an individual pawn knows
- Removed all previous settings in the Mod Settings section; the mod has grown large enough such that fine details are tedious to manage
- Added mod setting: configure whether the new tale-news UI should auto-pause the game
- More texts available for translation

There are complaints of late-game lag related to the use of this mod. This is simply a flaw in the currently-incomplete system. Please hold out for a few more days (no more than 7 days), because the fix is coming.
