Version 1.4.5 is finally here! While I haven't got the time to update this in the past few weeks, this gave me plenty of time to test and patch the mod.

- Fixed bug: NullReferenceException when spreading news
- Fixed bug: Finishing Off (from Allow Tools) on human pawns will no longer throw NullReferenceException (for real this time)
- Fixed bug: spreading news should no longer give the sender another mood debuff of the same event
- Changed news spread base chance due to traits from 5%/2%/0.05% to 40%/25%/10%
- Changed feature: Increased the number of dice throw from 3 to 5 for Deep Talk news spread checking
- Changed data structure to minimize size of data inside save-files
- Some underlying API changes here and there

The bugs that this version patches has essentially made all the previous TaleNews entries useless. Hence, previous entries of TaleNews will be discarded; your colonists will receive TaleNews correctly with a fresh start.
