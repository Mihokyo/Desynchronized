# Desynchronized
Desynchronized is a mod that modifies how Colonists react to the outside world.

>"I merely visited the Mod Scrapyard, found something interesting, and brought it back home. I mean, what could possibly go wrong?" ~ Vectorial1024, prior to releasing this mod.
# Features Galore
## Current Features
These features are already inside the mod, and should be working fine.
- Colonists do not know of Executions outside of their map
- Colonists do not know of Organ Harvests outside of their map

## Planned Features
These features will be implemented, but may take a while as I figure out the priority order.
- Colony pets that recently lost their master (_their master should be out of the map_) should probably not berserk, and should do something else
- Colonists should not know of the fate of their kidnapped kins during a raid, similar to how Banishments are handled in the game right now; instead, Colonists should receive only some generic thoughts on the Kidnapping

## Conceptual Ideas
I don't have much detail about these features in my mind but I think these features are possible and interesting.
- Introduce concepts and features to simulate information barricade and spread; this would allow for much advanced features to be introduced by this mod
- Colonists should react to Pawn Deaths (Colonists) outside of their map differently
- Colonists should react to cannibal meals differently (idea by Steam user megaboto)
- Other things

# Compatibility Announcements
## On Save-Game Compatibility
I can forsee a lot of features being added to this mod.
No problem on trying to add this to your existing playthrough, but there might be potential problems trying to remove this from your existing playthrough. I may consider adding a "ghost mode" for this mod to safely abort the functionality of this mod from inside the game.
## On Cross-Mod Compatibility
Well, there seems to have a lot of mods that could play well with this mod.
- Psychology
- Rumor Has It
- Questionable Ethics
- (perhaps some other mods)
