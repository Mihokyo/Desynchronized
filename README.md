# Desynchronized
Desynchronized is a mod that modifies how Colonists react to the outside world.

>"I merely visited the Scrapyard of Mods, found something interesting, and brought it back home. I mean, what could possibly go wrong?" ~Vectorial1024, prior to releasing this mod.
# Features Galore
## Current Features
- Colonists do not know of Executions outside of their map
- Colonists do not know of Organ Harvests outside of their map

## Planned Features
- Colony pets that recently lost their master (_their master should be out of the map_) should probably not berserk, and should do something else
- Colonists should not know of the fate of their kidnapped kins during a raid, similar to how Banishments are handled in the game right now; instead, Colonists should receive only some generic thoughts on the Kidnapping

## Conceptual Ideas
- Introduce concepts and features to simulate information barricade and spread; this would allow for much advanced features to be introduced by this mod
- Colonists should react to Pawn Deaths (Colonists) outside of their map differently
- Colonists should react to cannibal meals differently (idea by Steam user megaboto)
- Other things
